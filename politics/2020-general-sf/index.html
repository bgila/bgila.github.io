            <h3>The details</h3>
            <h4>How'd you decide who to endorse?</h4>
            <p>I consulted campaign websites (mainly to find who endorsed local candidates); <a href="https://ballotpedia.org/California_2020_ballot_propositions">Ballotpedia</a>, especially for CA propositions; my friends; and the YIMBY and SPUR voter guides, detailed below.</p>
            <ul>
                <li><a href="https://yimbyaction.org/endorsements/">YIMBY Action</a>: YIMBY (Yes in my backyard) Action is San Francisco's main pro-housing group. The primary political issue in the city, and California as a whole, is housing. YIMBY Action advocates for more housing, both legalizing market-rate apartments and funding subsidized housing.</li>
                <li><a href="https://www.spur.org/voter-guide/san-francisco-2020-11">SPUR</a>: SPUR is the San Francisco Bay Area Planning and Urban Research Association, and they publish endorsements accompanied by detailed analyses of the San Francisco and California propositions.</li>
                <li><em>Note: do not trust</em> the SF League of Pissed Off Voters. The group is <a href="https://netfile.com/Connect2/api/public/image/173905533">largely funded by</a> the same incumbents they're presumably "pissed off" at. They represent the leftist, anti-market wing of politics in San Francisco.</li>
            </ul>
            <h4>The candidates</h4>
            <h5><strong>President and Vice President</strong></h5>
            <p>You already know why you're voting for <strong>Joe Biden</strong>, but let me add that <a href="https://joebiden.com/housing/">his housing plan</a> is solid. He supports fully funding the Section 8 housing voucher program, a relatively cheap step that would dramatically reduce proverty. He also supports ending exclusionary single family home zoning, and creating a new renter's tax credit. I'm not optimistic Biden would actually, but he has the potential to move us in the right direction on housing.</p>
            <h5><strong>U.S. Representative, District 12</strong></h5>
            <p>I support <strong>Nancy Pelosi</strong> for reelection. She is the current Speaker of the House, and has enormous clout in Congress. Though I do wish we had a younger generation of leadership (the top 3 members of Democratic leadership in the House are all octogenarians), she's been effective in running the House, getting bills passed, and managing impeachment in a popular way.</p>
            <p>Her opponent, Shahid Buttar, is a democratic socialist in the Bernie vein, whose record focuses on activism. As you can imagine, almost everyone has endorsed Pelosi, and she is almost certain to win.</p>
            <h5><strong>State Senator, District 11</strong></h5>
            <div class="row">
                <div class="five columns">
                    <p><strong>Scott Wiener</strong> is the best legislator I've ever known. He's been tireless in advocating for more housing, our state's biggest issue. On housing, Wiener passed SB 35, which has led to <a href="https://medium.com/yimby/the-latest-on-vallco-explained-9d379c9a2773">the under-construction 2000-home project in Cupertino at the site of Vallco</a>, and tens of thousands of other units. Another obscure but critical housing bill he passed is SB 828 requiring cities to zone for their actual housing needs. It resulted in <a href="https://www.ocregister.com/2020/09/03/southern-california-cities-can-soon-object-to-giant-increases-in-housing-goals/">a quintupling of counties' housing goals</a> in Southern California, and the Bay Area <a href="https://www.bizjournals.com/sanjose/news/2020/06/22/bay-area-housing-requirement-2030-rhna.html">doubling its housing goals</a>.</p>
                    <p>Among many other bills, Wiener wrote California's bill protecting net neutrality, and has been working to extend nightlife hours so that bars can be open until 4am.</p>
                </div>
                <div class="seven columns">

                </div>
            </div>
            <p>By contrast, his opponent, Jackie Fielder, has a housing plan to spend $100B over 10 years to build 100,000 more homes. Unfortunately, we have a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/California_housing_shortage">shortage of more than 3 million homes</a> (we are 49th in housing units per resident), so this would barely make a dent in the crisis. Fielder <a href="https://jackieforsenate.com/transportation">opposes</a> SB1, a $1B gas tax to fund transportation and transit (despite 83% support for it in SF, its incentive against driving gasoline vehicles, and its funding for transit), because it is "regressive" and "structurally makes dependent on more gas," a position emblematic of her tendency to focus on purity over pragmatism.</p>
            <h5><strong>State Assembly, Districts 17 and 19</strong></h5>
            <p><strong>David Chiu</strong> and <strong>Phil Ting</strong> are both pro-housing Democrats. Neither are facing Democrats, and both are prohibitive favorites for reelection.</p>
            <h5><strong>Board of Supervisors</strong></h5>
            <p><em>Explanation WIP</em>I outsourced these endorsements to YIMBY Action. Again, they're <strong>Marjan Philhour (1)</strong>, <strong>Danny Sauter (3)</strong>, <strong>Vallie Brown (5)</strong>, <strong>Myrna Melgar (7)</strong>, no one (9), and <strong>Ahsha Safai (11)</strong>.</p>
            <h5><strong>Board of Education</strong></h5>
            <p>I outsourced these endorsements to my favorite SF politicians, Scott Wiener and London Breed; they endorsed <strong>Jenny Lam</strong>, an incumbent, and <strong>Michelle Parker</strong>, a challenger. We're allowed to vote for up to 4, so I'd be open to additional recommendations here.</p>
            <h5><strong>BART Director, Districts 7 and 9</strong></h5>
            <p><strong>Lateefah Simon</strong> and <strong>Bevan Dufty</strong> are both incumbent BART directors that have supported housing developments on BART land. Dufty also came out in support of controversial SB 50, which would have upzoned residential areas near transit.</p>
            <br>
            <h4>The propositions</h4>
            <h5><strong>Prop 14, stem cell funding: No</strong></h5>
            <p>This proposition would renew funding for the California Institute for Regenerative Medicine (CIRM), which was created and financed by voters in a 2004 proposition, and has since run out of money. Prop 14 lacks endorsements from prominent CA politicians, and $5.5B is a lot of money. There's no clear rationale for this spending, and I think we could do a lot better with $5.5B (for scale, the entire SF Muni budget is $1.3B).</p>
            <h5><strong>Prop 15, increase commercial property taxes: Yes</strong></h5>
            <p>Prop 15 is a significant step in undoing the biggest mistake in CA political history, Prop 13. Under 1978's Prop 13, property taxes cannot go up with the value of the property; instead, they go up only 2% or inflation, whichever is lower. Imagine that in 1980, Apple bought a building in Cupertino for $5M, and an Apple employee bought a house for $50,000. Then, after 40 years of 2% growth, Apple pays 1% annual property taxes on $11M in assessed value, and the employee pays $1,100 in annual taxes on $110,000 in assessed value, even if the Apple campus is now worth $200M and the home is worth $2M.</p>
            <p>This year's Prop 15 undoes Prop 13 for commercial properties, while retaining it for residences. It phases in beginning in 2022, and by 2026 would assess business property taxes based on property value. It is expected to generate ~$10B towards schools, community colleges, and local governments.</p>
            <p>One negative effect of Prop 13 is that it's encouraged cities (for example, Bay Area suburbs) to build more office space than housing. This is because revenue from housing (property taxes) is capped by Prop 13, and while that applies to businesses as well, payroll and other taxes can be levied on businesses. Unfortunately, Prop 15 may exacerbate this imbalance, by making commercial property even more profitable for local governments. However, this potential drawback is not serious enough for me to oppose the measure.</p>
            <p>Prop 15 has been endorsed by most prominent state politicians, as well as all major Democratic 2020 presidential nominees.</p>
            <h5><strong>Prop 16, reverse affirmative action ban: No endorsement</strong></h5>
            <p>This proposition would repeal a 1996 proposition which stated that the California government and universities cannot "discriminate against or grant preferential treatment to persons on the basis of race, sex, color, ethnicity, or national origin in public employment, public education, and public contracting." If passed, it would allow affirmative action programs to be reinstituted at the University of California system.</p>
            <p>A lesser-discussed potential impact of Prop 209 would be on government jobs and contracts. As the  legislature wrote in their <a href="https://leginfo.legislature.ca.gov/faces/billTextClient.xhtml?bill_id=201920200ACA5">statement</a> placing Prop 209 on the ballot, its implementation "cost women and people of color over $1,000,000,000 annually in lost contract awards." A <a href="https://people.ucsc.edu/~marion/Papers/Prop209_oct2007_revision.pdf">UCSC study</a> finds that contract prices fell 5.6% after Prop 209, as state governments were no longer required to prefer minority-owned businesss. Conversely, a <a href="https://www.law.berkeley.edu/files/thcsj/Free_to_Compete.pdf">Berkeley Law study</a> emphasizes the return of "good old boy" networks, in which well-connected, nonminority contractors had more influence in government contracting, in preventing equal access to minority businesses after the passage of Prop 209.</p>
            <p>Prop 16 is endorsed by most state politicians, as well as SPUR and the ACLU of California.</p>
            <h5><strong>Prop 17, allow parolees to vote: Yes</strong></h5>
            <p>This proposition restores the right to vote for people on parole for felonies (though not those currently serving their sentence). I believe all adult citizens should have the right to vote, and am in favor of this proposition.</p>
            <h5><strong>Prop 18, allow those who'll turn 18 by the general to vote in the primary: Yes</strong></h5>
            <p>This proposition prepones your voting age so that anyone who'd be old enough to vote by the general election could also vote in the primary election. CA would join 18 other states in making this change. It makes sense to let someone vote for a complete primary/general cycle, and aligning eligiblity to that.</p>
            <h5><strong>Prop 19, strengthen Prop 13 property tax loophole for those 55 and older in exchange for reducing its inheritability: Yes</strong></h5>
            <p>Back to Prop 13 (see my intro above) -- one especially galling provision of it, added in subsequent amendments, is that it's inheritable. In California, we have a feudal system, in which if you were lucky enough to buy real estate years ago, your children (and even grandchildren!) can inherit not just your property but your artificially low tax rate. Prop 13's tax rate is inheritable not just on your primary home, but also on up to $1,000,000 of <em>assessed</em> value of other property. So if your San Francisco landlord owns 5 other apartments, currently worth a total of $8,000,000 but assessed at a tenth of that, her children currently can inherit the $72,000/year property tax break along with the apartments.</p>
            <p>Prop 19 would get rid of this tax break; allowing Prop 13's tax rate to only be inherited on the primary home in which the inheritor resides. This is the reason I'm in favor: it reduces the inheritability of Prop 13.</p>
            <p>The trade-off is that Prop 19 would actually increase the value of the Prop 13 tax break for those 55 and older. They are currently able to take their artificially low Prop 13 rates with them if they sell their home and buy another (a) in the same county and (b) for no more than their current home was worth. Prop 19 removes both of those restrictions. I believe older homeowners are huge beneficiaries of California's tax system, are generally very wealthy due to appreciation of their property values, and do not need additional tax breaks, and thus do not support this provision of Prop 19. However, one silver lining is that this generosity might encourage homeowners living in high-cost, high-opportunity areas of the state to move elsewhere, increasing the supply of houses in Cupertino, Palo Alto, and Berkeley (for example) available for younger folks in the workforce.</p>
            <h5><strong>Prop 20, lengthen criminal sentencing: No</strong></h5>
            <p>I don't support lengthening criminal sentences, and especially not removing the possibility of parole, as this proposition does for 51 crimes. This proposition is supported by the Republican Party and Devin Nunes, and opposed by the Democratic Party, former Governor Jerry Brown, and the ACLU of California.</p>
            <h5><strong>Prop 21, allow localities to expand rent control: Yes</strong></h5>
            <p>Since the 1995 Costa-Hawkins Act, cities in California have been heavily restricted in passing rent control laws. They're only allowed to impose rent control on (a) apartments, not single-family homes or condos (b) built before 1995 (or a city's existing cutoff date, 1979 for San Francisco).</p>
            <p>Prop 21 would allow cities to impose rent control on (a) single-family homes, as long as they're owned by individuals who own at most 2 homes (b) which were built more than 15 years ago. New construction is exempt from rent control for 15 years (to allow developers to profit from the building) before it kicks in.</p>
            <p>Another change is that under current law, when a rent-controlled tenant leaves, the landlord can raise rents to market rate. This incentivizes landlords to evict heavily rent-controlled tenants. Prop 21 allows cities to cap the rent increase when a vacancy occurs at 15% every 3 years. This may reduce the eviction incentive, but it could also incentivize landlords to sell the house to a new owner (who might live in it), or rent it out to their friends rather than the broader market.</p>
            <p>The cause of high housing prices in California is that supply is too low because we haven't built enough homes. Prop 21 would not solve this problem. At the margin, it might worsen it, by reducing the profit developers would expect on their new construction. This is my biggest concern about this bill. However, I looked at the <a href="http://ternercenter.berkeley.edu/uploads/Rent_Control_Paper_053018.pdf">UC Berkeley</a> study cited by SPUR to show Prop 21 would reduce housing construction, and the study drew its conclusion by asking industry experts, who said that even a 40-year exclusion of new construction from rent control would reduce the supply of new housing. While I understand why those in the real estate industry would resist any rent control, a 40-year exclusion seems like ample time to recoup investment on a property. Indeed, so much can change in a 40-year timeframe, from laws to the regional economy, that I find the conclusions implausible. At any rate, the far bigger obstacle to housing supply is that apartments are illegal to build in 70% of SF, as well as the vast majority of other residential land in California, and we should address zoning and other restrictions rather than using the supply concerns to block any expansion of rent control.</p>
            <p>Ultimately, though I don't expect to personally benefit from rent control, I recognize its value for neighborhood stability. Expanding rent control might reduce the rancor between tenant groups and more pro-development groups.</p>
