                <p>In America, driving is super convenient, and sometimes hard to avoid. Unfortunately, cars have a variety of costs that are externalized, borne not by the driver but by their local community, and the environment as a whole. Incentives are good: if it were more expensive to drive and to park more folks would seek out alternatives. While there's no replacement for pubilc policy change, I decided to partially align my own incentives. Retroactive to the start of 2020, I'm donating to <a href="https://www.projectvesta.org/">Project Vesta</a> with the intention of offsetting the carbon emissions associated with my driving and flying. I hope others consider doing the same, or donating towards carbon offsetting programs, because I believe climate change is the biggest medium-term threat our society faces.</p>

        <div class="container" id="cars-bad">
            <div>
                <h5><a class="highlight" href="#cars-bad">Cars are actually very expensive</a></h5>
                <p>What does it cost to drive to dinner downtown?</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Narrowly, a 20 mile round-trip drive downtown in a 30 mpg compact SUV costs $2.40 if gas costs $3.60 per gallon.</li>
                    <li>Add around $2 for street parking, or more for garage parking, if you're lucky enough to live in a city that charges for parking.</li>
                    <li>The IRS, an organization not known for its generosity, <a href="https://www.shrm.org/ResourcesAndTools/hr-topics/benefits/Pages/IRS-lowers-standard-mileage-rate-for-2021.aspx#:~:text=For%202021%2C%20standard%20mileage%20rates,from%2057.5%20cents%20in%202020.">reimburses $0.56 per mile</a>, much more than the $0.12 per mile gas costs as calculated above. That's because depreciation, maintenance, and insurance are also substantial costs of vehicle ownership. At that rate, you'd need to spend <em>$11.20 plus parking for that 20-mile trip</em>, a price point that might encourage you to take the train instead.</li>
                    <li>Of course, it's possible to achieve lower per-mile costs, for example with a fuel-efficient, used car. The true cost is still much higher than the cost of fuel. However, depreciation, maintenance, and insurance are invisible, and they are somewhat fixed costs. In other words, once you own a car, you have strong incentives to use it because you're already paying for some insurance and depreciation regardless.</li>
                </ul>
                <p>Unfortunately, the above doesn't include external costs of car ownership and usage. In America, we've designed our entire country around cars to the extent it's almost impossible to imagine any other way of doing things. These include negative impacts to our local community, and to the global environment.</p>
                <p>Once you start interpreting the built environment as horrible hacks to facilitate the omnipresence of cars, it's impossible to go back.</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Manhattan, one of the least car-oriented places in the United States, devotes <a href="https://nextcity.org/daily/entry/how-much-public-space-does-a-city-need-UN-Habitat-joan-clos-50-percent">36% of its area</a> to streets, the vast majority of which is dedicated to private cars, <a href="https://www1.nyc.gov/assets/planning/download/pdf/plans/transportation/peripheral_travel_02c.pdf">despite that only 5% of its commutes are by car</a> (and only 7% are by bus).</li>
                    <li>In San Francisco, Golden Gate Park has cars allowed on 92% of its streets, yet advocates are having to fight to keep the remaining 8% open for people and bikes.</li>
                    <li>Ever wonder why you enjoyed your vacation to Disneyworld, or a dense European city? In part, it's because they were walkable places. In the United States, parking requirements are ubiqitous. Cities like my hometown of Cupertino <a href="https://twitter.com/barakgila/status/1187506814943842305">even require bars to provide parking!</a> Required parking is a self-fulfilling prophecy. When your streets are strip malls littered with parking lagoons, it's miserable to get around any other way than a car.</li>
                </ul>
                <p>Our car culture had racist intentions in the past and has ongoing racist outcomes. Also, it is dangerous to humans.</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>The <a href="https://www.integrapeople.com/news/2017/05/the-top-10-most-expensive-construction-projects-in-the-world/159#:~:text=The%20Interstate%20Highway%20System%2C%20%24459,almost%2035%20years%20to%20complete.">most expensive project in world history</a> was the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interstate_Highway_System">$530 billion</a> (in current dollars) Interstate Highway System. It had some good outcomes, but also facilitated white flight from cities and soul-crushing suburban sprawl. At the time, Black communities had even less political power than they do now, so highways <a href="https://www.vox.com/2015/5/14/8605917/highways-interstate-cities-history">tore through Black communities</a>. Even today, <a href="https://la.streetsblog.org/2020/10/07/city-of-downey-officially-opposes-full-metro-605-5-freeway-widening-impacting-downey-homes/">LA is planning to demolish hundreds of homes</a> for a freeway widening project.</li>
                    <li>There were <a href="https://www.iihs.org/topics/fatality-statistics/detail/yearly-snapshot">36,000 car crash deaths</a> in America in 2019, up from 33,000 a decade ago. The number of injuries is far higher, and even cities with Vision Zero plans aren't making progress (<a href="https://sfgov.org/scorecards/transportation/traffic-fatalities">see SF for example</a>).</li>
                    <li>Americans associate cars with independence, but privileging the convenience of drivers comes at a huge cost to the freedom of everyone else. Kids under the age of 16 and others who cannot drive, like folks who can't afford it, or those with some medical conditions, are treated as second class citizens. Many parents won't let their kids walk half a mile to school, whether in a busy urban area or a sleepy suburb, for fear of traffic violence.</li>
                    <li>Hopefully, you're aware of the environmental costs of carbon emissions from gasoline-powered cars. I'll add that your Tesla is not exempt! Manufacturing a midsize electric vehicle <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/building-electric-cars-how-much-pollution-versus-gas-powered-vehicles-2019-11">produces 15% more emissions</a> than its gasoline-powered equivalent, and that gap grows with battery size. Once that electric car is released to our roads, it produces many of the same particulate emissions (like tire erosion) that are responsible for <a href="https://www.ucsusa.org/resources/vehicles-air-pollution-human-health">30,000 premature American deaths</a> per year.</li>
                    <li>In the past, we put lead in gasoline, which poisoned a generation of Americans (<a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/10845777/#:~:text=The%20CogAT%20norm%20comparisons%20also,at%20lower%20blood%20lead%20levels.&text=The%20findings%20with%20respect%20to,more%20aggressive%20and%20delinquent%20behavior.">lead exposure in children is associated with lower IQ and higher aggression</a>) and arguably contributed to increased in crime.</li>
                    <li>The more we learn, the worse the health statistics: in 2010, Japanese scientists <a href="https://www.reuters.com/article/us-birth-roads/living-near-a-major-road-tied-to-preterm-birth-study-idUSTRE6B10HA20101202">found</a> that living near a major road was associated with a 50% increase in premature birth. In 2019, Berkeley research <a href="https://are.berkeley.edu/~mlanderson/pdf/air_pollution_highways.pdf">found</a> living downwind of a highway increased mortality among seniors by around 5%.</li>

                    <p>Finding a good bike route can be the difference between a terrifying trip and a relaxing one. It can be hit and miss, but bike infrastructure in many American cities has gotten better over the last decade and continues to improve.</p>
                    <h5><strong>Road hierarchy</strong></h5>
                    <p>Here's the types of road surfaces you should prefer, in order starting from the best.</p>
                    <div class="row">
                        <div class="three columns">
                            <img style="max-width: 100%; box-sizing: border-box;" src="boulder-creek-path.png" alt="boulder creek path">
                            <p><strong>Paved car-free bike path.</strong> Usually allows pedestrians too, like the Boulder Creek Path to downtown shown above. Boulder, Colorado has an exceptional network of these multi-use paths.</p>
                        </div>
                        <div class="three columns">
                            <img style="max-width: 100%; box-sizing: border-box;" src="folsom.png" alt="folsom">
                            <p><strong>Protected bike lane</strong>, in which cars are separated from bikes by parking or a buffer. These are less effective when there are many right-turning cars.</p>
                        </div>
                        <div class="three columns">
                            <img style="max-width: 100%; box-sizing: border-box;" src="sunnyvale.png" alt="sunnyvale">
                            <p><strong>Bike lane, no right-hand-side parking.</strong> These can be pretty comfortable, unless they're too narrow, the road surface is bad, or there are many right turns.</p>
                        </div>
                        <div class="three columns">
                            <img style="max-width: 100%; box-sizing: border-box;" src="fulton.png" alt="fulton">
                            <p><strong>Bike lane, with right-hand-side parking.</strong> These can be deceptive, because you're in the door zone, as discussed below. You may need to ignore it and take the car lane.</p>
                        </div>
                    </div>
                    <p>If none of these options are available, choose between: taking the entire car lane (see below), biking on the road shoulder / right-most part of the lane, or taking the sidewalk (if available) to avoid competing with fast traffic on narrow lanes.</p>
                    <h5><strong>Navigation (use Google)</strong></h5>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Audio navigation from Google Maps is great. You don't need to pull out your phone (even to start navigation, just ask Google assistant), and it uses road names and is generally easy to follow.</li>
                        <li>Google Maps's bike routefinding is pretty good. It'll minimize elevation gain and prefer roads with bike lanes.</li>
                        <li>Use Street View to scope out potentially sketchy sections of the route in advance.</li>
                        <li>Unfortunately, bike routes tend to end abruptly, funneling you to compete with cars on busy roads. The area around South Van Ness and Howard St is a good example of this in San Francisco. If you encounter this, or otherwise feel unsafe on your ride, it's fine to head for the sidewalk and either ride on it, or stop and search for an alternate route.</li>
                    </ul>
                </div>
            </div>
            <div class="container" id="safety">
                <div>
                    <h4><a class="highlight" href="#safety">Safe riding tips: offense is the best defense</a></h4>
                    <div class="row">
                        <div class="seven columns">
                            <p>In my opinion, safe urban bike commuting is counterintuitive. Novices tend to fear cars, and therefore stick to the right-most part of the bike lane (or car lane). This can cause major issues.</p>
                            <ul>
                                <li>It places you in the door zone. <em>Dooring</em> is when a driver opens a car door either directly into you or right in front of you. This is what caused <a href="https://sf.streetsblog.org/2020/03/09/one-year-later-remembering-tess-rothstein/">Tess Rothstein's tragic death</a>. Overall, dooring is responsible for <a href="https://www.sfmta.com/sites/default/files/reports/2016/San%20Francisco%20Collisions%20Report%202012%202015.pdf">16% of injury/fatal bike crashes in San Francisco</a> in which the cyclist is not at fault.</li>
                                <li>Similarly, it leaves you with less time and space to react if a car pulls out of a parallel parking spot, or right turns, onto your path.</li>
                                <li>Finally, it can allow cars to pass you within the same lane, without enough distance between you, which can be dangerous and feels terrifying.</li>
                            </ul>
                        </div>
                        <div class="five columns">
                            <img style="max-width: 100%; box-sizing: border-box;" src="door.jpeg" alt="Door zone">
                            <p style="color:gray;">Stay away from the door zone. If that puts you in the close pass zone, take the lane. source: <a href="https://www.dutchreach.org/dooring-defense-for-cyclists2-2-2-2-2/">dutchreach.org</a></p>
                        </div>
                    </div>
                    <p>Instead, avoid the door zone, and when that's too close to cars for comfort, <em>take the lane</em>: bike in the middle (or even towards the left) of the car lane to force cars to pass you in the next lane over. You still need to be careful: always look over your shoulder before taking the lane, but I do this all the time in San Francisco.</p>
                    <p>Taking the lane feels aggressive, but especially in urban, dense areas with slow-moving average traffic speeds, drivers rarely get annoyed. It's even <a href="https://www.rei.com/learn/expert-advice/riding-traffic.html">recommended by REI</a>. Remember that, in good visibility (daytime or nighttime with bright lights), cars are highly unlikely to deliberately murder you by plowing you from behind. Plus, it's affirming and satisfying to take the space on the road that you deserve, and let the cars wait their turn.</p>
                    <p>Another potentially dangerous interaction is merges: you're approaching an intersection in the bike lane, and a car must merge across the bike lane before turning right. Assume drivers don't check their mirrors and may not notice you during a merge. When possible, look behind and to your left before the intersection, and if it's clear, preemptively merge into the car lane well before the intersection, so that cars must merge right behind you. As a bonus, this makes it easier to pass (on the left) any queue of cars waiting to turn right to quickly reach the intersection.</p>
                    <h5><strong>Caveats</strong></h5>
                    <p>This guide is based on my perspective as (a) a white guy who is (b) tempermentally in the top 10% in terms of cycling aggressiveness. I'm aware that other people, especially if from different identity groups, may experience the road differently than I do. For example, a woman can get catcalled, or a Black cyclist can face more adversarial drivers, or hassling from police even for legitimate maneuvers. I think those issues are deplorable, and we should work to address them, and I don't mean to suggest the above tips will work for everyone.</p>
