                <p>In America, driving is super convenient, and sometimes hard to avoid. Unfortunately, cars have a variety of costs that are externalized, borne not by the driver but by their local community, and the environment as a whole. Incentives are good: if it were more expensive to drive and to park more folks would seek out alternatives. While there's no replacement for pubilc policy change, I decided to partially align my own incentives. Retroactive to the start of 2020, I'm donating to <a href="https://www.projectvesta.org/">Project Vesta</a> with the intention of offsetting the carbon emissions associated with my driving and flying. I hope others consider doing the same, or donating towards carbon offsetting programs, because I believe climate change is the biggest medium-term threat our society faces.</p>

                <h5><a class="highlight" href="#cars-bad">Cars are actually very expensive</a></h5>
                <h6>What does it cost to drive to dinner downtown?</h6>
                <ul>
                    <li>Narrowly, a 20 mile round-trip drive downtown in a 30 mpg compact SUV costs $2.40 if gas costs $3.60 per gallon.</li>
                    <li>Add around $2 for street parking, or more for garage parking, if you're lucky enough to live in a city that charges for parking.</li>
                    <li>The IRS, an organization not known for its generosity, <a href="https://www.shrm.org/ResourcesAndTools/hr-topics/benefits/Pages/IRS-lowers-standard-mileage-rate-for-2021.aspx#:~:text=For%202021%2C%20standard%20mileage%20rates,from%2057.5%20cents%20in%202020.">reimburses $0.56 per mile</a>, much more than the $0.12 per mile gas costs as calculated above. That's because depreciation, maintenance, and insurance are also substantial costs of vehicle ownership. At that rate, you'd need to spend <em>$11.20 plus parking for that 20-mile trip</em>, a price point that might encourage you to take the train instead.</li>
                    <li>Of course, it's possible to achieve lower per-mile costs, for example with a fuel-efficient, used car. The true cost is still much higher than the cost of fuel. However, depreciation, maintenance, and insurance are invisible, and they are somewhat fixed costs. In other words, once you own a car, you have strong incentives to use it because you're already paying for some insurance and depreciation regardless.</li>
                </ul>
                <p>Unfortunately, the above doesn't include external costs of car ownership and usage. In America, we've designed our entire country around cars to the extent it's almost impossible to imagine any other way of doing things. These include negative impacts to our local community, and to the global environment.</p>
                <h6>Once you start interpreting the built environment as horrible hacks to facilitate the omnipresence of cars, it's impossible to unsee.</h6>
                <ul>
                    <li>Manhattan, one of the least car-oriented places in the United States, devotes <a href="https://nextcity.org/daily/entry/how-much-public-space-does-a-city-need-UN-Habitat-joan-clos-50-percent">36% of its area</a> to streets, the vast majority of which is dedicated to private cars, <a href="https://www1.nyc.gov/assets/planning/download/pdf/plans/transportation/peripheral_travel_02c.pdf">despite that only 5% of its commutes are by car</a> (and only 7% are by bus).</li>
                    <li>In San Francisco, Golden Gate Park has cars allowed on 92% of its streets, yet advocates are having to fight to keep the remaining 8% open for people and bikes.</li>
                    <li>Ever wonder why you enjoyed your vacation to Disneyworld, or a dense European city? In part, it's because they were walkable places. In the United States, parking requirements are ubiqitous. Cities like my hometown of Cupertino <a href="https://twitter.com/barakgila/status/1187506814943842305">even require bars to provide parking!</a> Required parking is a self-fulfilling prophecy. When your streets are strip malls littered with parking lagoons, it's miserable to get around any other way than a car.</li>
                </ul>
                <h6>Our car culture had racist intentions in the past and has ongoing racist outcomes. Also, it is dangerous to humans.</h6>
                <ul>
                    <li>The <a href="https://www.integrapeople.com/news/2017/05/the-top-10-most-expensive-construction-projects-in-the-world/159#:~:text=The%20Interstate%20Highway%20System%2C%20%24459,almost%2035%20years%20to%20complete.">most expensive project in world history</a> was the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interstate_Highway_System">$530 billion</a> (in current dollars) Interstate Highway System. It had some good outcomes, but also facilitated white flight from cities and soul-crushing suburban sprawl. At the time, Black communities had even less political power than they do now, so highways <a href="https://www.vox.com/2015/5/14/8605917/highways-interstate-cities-history">tore through Black communities</a>. Even today, <a href="https://la.streetsblog.org/2020/10/07/city-of-downey-officially-opposes-full-metro-605-5-freeway-widening-impacting-downey-homes/">LA is planning to demolish hundreds of homes</a> for a freeway widening project.</li>
                    <li>There were <a href="https://www.iihs.org/topics/fatality-statistics/detail/yearly-snapshot">36,000 car crash deaths</a> in America in 2019, up from 33,000 a decade ago. The number of injuries is far higher, and even cities with Vision Zero plans aren't making progress (<a href="https://sfgov.org/scorecards/transportation/traffic-fatalities">see SF for example</a>).</li>
                    <li>Americans associate cars with independence, but privileging the convenience of drivers comes at a huge cost to the freedom of everyone else. Kids under the age of 16 and others who cannot drive, like folks who can't afford it, or those with some medical conditions, are treated as second class citizens. Many parents won't let their kids walk half a mile to school, whether in a busy urban area or a sleepy suburb, for fear of traffic violence.</li>
                    <li>Hopefully, you're aware of the environmental costs of carbon emissions from gasoline-powered cars. I'll add that your Tesla is not exempt! Manufacturing a midsize electric vehicle <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/building-electric-cars-how-much-pollution-versus-gas-powered-vehicles-2019-11">produces 15% more emissions</a> than its gasoline-powered equivalent, and that gap grows with battery size. Once that electric car is released to our roads, it produces many of the same particulate emissions (like tire erosion) that are responsible for <a href="https://www.ucsusa.org/resources/vehicles-air-pollution-human-health">30,000 premature American deaths</a> per year.</li>
                    <li>In the past, we put lead in gasoline, which poisoned a generation of Americans (<a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/10845777/#:~:text=The%20CogAT%20norm%20comparisons%20also,at%20lower%20blood%20lead%20levels.&text=The%20findings%20with%20respect%20to,more%20aggressive%20and%20delinquent%20behavior.">lead exposure in children is associated with lower IQ and higher aggression</a>) and arguably contributed to increased in crime.</li>
                    <li>The more we learn, the worse the health statistics: in 2010, Japanese scientists <a href="https://www.reuters.com/article/us-birth-roads/living-near-a-major-road-tied-to-preterm-birth-study-idUSTRE6B10HA20101202">found</a> that living near a major road was associated with a 50% increase in premature birth. In 2019, Berkeley research <a href="https://are.berkeley.edu/~mlanderson/pdf/air_pollution_highways.pdf">found</a> living downwind of a highway increased mortality among seniors by around 5%.</li>

                    <h6>Most of the above problems were from governmental mistakes and they'll need public solutions.</h6>
                    <p>We'll need public actions more radical than the Green New Deal (which focuses on jobs and public investment) to address them. As a start, I support carbon taxes, bus-only lanes on urban and suburban freeways combined with frequent, convenient service, <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/cities/2015/may/05/amsterdam-bicycle-capital-world-transport-cycling-kindermoord#:~:text=Entire%20Amsterdam%20neighbourhoods%20were%20destroyed,bicycles%20would%20eventually%20disappear%20altogether.&text=All%20that%20growing%20traffic%20took,of%203%2C300%20deaths%20in%201971.">following in Amsterdam's footsteps</a> to transform our cities to prioritize everyone but cars, and then making it more expensive to use cars with congestion pricing and increased registration/per mile fees.</p>
                    <h6>I'll start by changing my own incentives around driving and flying.</h6>
                    <p>Just as plant-focused restaurants might open in a community with many vegans and vegetarians, I hope individual action can encourage a public policy change. I've already made some changes in my behavior since I learned more about urbanism (like getting around the Peninsula by biking and taking Caltrain, rather than always driving), but it's good to align my incentives along these lines.</p>
                    <p>Relatedly, I believe climate change is super important, and among the most important reason to reduce our car usage. So, I decided to start by partially offsetting the carbon emissions of my driving and flying. (I'm excluding non-carbon externalities, costs associated with car/plane manufacturing and disposal, and other indirect costs.)</p>
                    <h6>Concretely, I'll pay to offset 0.3 kg of carbon emissions per car-mile, and 0.15 kg of carbon emissions per plane-mile.</h6>
                    <ul>
                        <li>The <a href="https://nepis.epa.gov/Exe/ZyNET.exe/P100JPPH.TXT?ZyActionD=ZyDocument&Client=EPA&Index=2011+Thru+2015&Docs=&Query=&Time=&EndTime=&SearchMethod=1&TocRestrict=n&Toc=&TocEntry=&QField=&QFieldYear=&QFieldMonth=&QFieldDay=&IntQFieldOp=0&ExtQFieldOp=0&XmlQuery=&File=D%3A%5Czyfiles%5CIndex%20Data%5C11thru15%5CTxt%5C00000011%5CP100JPPH.txt&User=ANONYMOUS&Password=anonymous&SortMethod=h%7C-&MaximumDocuments=1&FuzzyDegree=0&ImageQuality=r75g8/r75g8/x150y150g16/i425&Display=hpfr&DefSeekPage=x&SearchBack=ZyActionL&Back=ZyActionS&BackDesc=Results%20page&MaximumPages=1&ZyEntry=1&SeekPage=x&ZyPURL">EPA calculates vehicle emissions</a> as 9 kg of CO<sub>2</sub> per mile, and the average mpg of cars I use is 30 mpg. In theory, I'd divide the resulting 0.3 kg/mile emissions by the total number of people in the vehicle (excluding Uber drivers etc). In practice, this is annoying to do and I'm overestimating all trips as solo instead.</li>
                        <li>I'm using <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1nkGdtmkPmSb4eFxVyarPp7HXFCKR6lTPd-uB0qc5c_w/edit">this calculator from the United Nations'  ICAO</a> for plane emissions. Longer flights are more efficient, so I'm averaging the 0.075 kg/plane-mile it outputs for SFO-MEL and the 0.225 kg/plane-mile for SFO-SLC.</li>

                            <p>In my opinion, safe urban bike commuting is counterintuitive. Novices tend to fear cars, and therefore stick to the right-most part of the bike lane (or car lane). This can cause major issues.</p>
                            <ul>
                                <li>It places you in the door zone. <em>Dooring</em> is when a driver opens a car door either directly into you or right in front of you. This is what caused <a href="https://sf.streetsblog.org/2020/03/09/one-year-later-remembering-tess-rothstein/">Tess Rothstein's tragic death</a>. Overall, dooring is responsible for <a href="https://www.sfmta.com/sites/default/files/reports/2016/San%20Francisco%20Collisions%20Report%202012%202015.pdf">16% of injury/fatal bike crashes in San Francisco</a> in which the cyclist is not at fault.</li>
                                <li>Similarly, it leaves you with less time and space to react if a car pulls out of a parallel parking spot, or right turns, onto your path.</li>
                                <li>Finally, it can allow cars to pass you within the same lane, without enough distance between you, which can be dangerous and feels terrifying.</li>
                            </ul>
                        </div>
                        <div class="five columns">
                            <img style="max-width: 100%; box-sizing: border-box;" src="door.jpeg" alt="Door zone">
                            <p style="color:gray;">Stay away from the door zone. If that puts you in the close pass zone, take the lane. source: <a href="https://www.dutchreach.org/dooring-defense-for-cyclists2-2-2-2-2/">dutchreach.org</a></p>
                        </div>
                    </div>
                    <p>Instead, avoid the door zone, and when that's too close to cars for comfort, <em>take the lane</em>: bike in the middle (or even towards the left) of the car lane to force cars to pass you in the next lane over. You still need to be careful: always look over your shoulder before taking the lane, but I do this all the time in San Francisco.</p>
                    <p>Taking the lane feels aggressive, but especially in urban, dense areas with slow-moving average traffic speeds, drivers rarely get annoyed. It's even <a href="https://www.rei.com/learn/expert-advice/riding-traffic.html">recommended by REI</a>. Remember that, in good visibility (daytime or nighttime with bright lights), cars are highly unlikely to deliberately murder you by plowing you from behind. Plus, it's affirming and satisfying to take the space on the road that you deserve, and let the cars wait their turn.</p>
                    <p>Another potentially dangerous interaction is merges: you're approaching an intersection in the bike lane, and a car must merge across the bike lane before turning right. Assume drivers don't check their mirrors and may not notice you during a merge. When possible, look behind and to your left before the intersection, and if it's clear, preemptively merge into the car lane well before the intersection, so that cars must merge right behind you. As a bonus, this makes it easier to pass (on the left) any queue of cars waiting to turn right to quickly reach the intersection.</p>
                    <h5><strong>Caveats</strong></h5>
                    <p>This guide is based on my perspective as (a) a white guy who is (b) tempermentally in the top 10% in terms of cycling aggressiveness. I'm aware that other people, especially if from different identity groups, may experience the road differently than I do. For example, a woman can get catcalled, or a Black cyclist can face more adversarial drivers, or hassling from police even for legitimate maneuvers. I think those issues are deplorable, and we should work to address them, and I don't mean to suggest the above tips will work for everyone.</p>
