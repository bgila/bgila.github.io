                <p>In America, driving is super convenient, and sometimes hard to avoid. Unfortunately, cars have a variety of costs that are externalized, borne not by the driver but by their local community and the environment as a whole. Incentives are good: if it were more expensive to drive and to park, more folks would seek out alternatives.</p>
                <p>While there's no replacement for public policy change, I decided to partially align my own incentives. I'm donating to <a href="https://www.projectvesta.org/">Project Vesta</a> with the intention of offsetting the carbon emissions associated with my driving and flying retroactive to the start of 2020. I'm doing this because I think climate change is an important medium-term threat, and this may encourage me to drive less.</p>
                <p>I start with an anti-car screed intended not to guilt-trip anyone (I have used and continue to use cars) but rather to inform you of their downsides and motivate my decision to try to reduce my driving with incentives. If you're not interested in being urbanist-pilled, feel free to skip ahead to the section about <a href="#incentives-good">offsetting generally</a> or <a href="#project-vesta">through Project Vesta specifically</a>.</p>

                         <ul>
                            <li>Narrowly, a 20 mile round-trip drive downtown in a 30 mpg compact SUV costs $2.40 if gas costs $3.60 per gallon.</li>
                            <li>Add around $2 for street parking, or more for garage parking, if you're lucky enough to live in a city that charges for parking.</li>
                            <li>The IRS, an organization not known for its generosity, <a href="https://www.shrm.org/ResourcesAndTools/hr-topics/benefits/Pages/IRS-lowers-standard-mileage-rate-for-2021.aspx#:~:text=For%202021%2C%20standard%20mileage%20rates,from%2057.5%20cents%20in%202020.">allows deducting $0.56 per mile on taxes</a>, much more than the $0.12 per mile gas costs as calculated above. That's because depreciation, maintenance, and insurance are also substantial costs of vehicle ownership. At that rate, you'd need to spend <em>$11.20 plus parking for that 20-mile trip</em>, a price point that might encourage you to take the train instead.</li>
                            <li>Of course, it's possible to achieve lower per-mile costs, for example with a fuel-efficient, cheap car, though the true cost is still much higher than the cost of fuel. However, depreciation, maintenance, and insurance are invisible, and they are somewhat fixed costs. In other words, once you own a car, you have strong incentives to use it because you're already paying for some insurance and depreciation regardless.</li>

                <p>Unfortunately, the above doesn't include external costs of car ownership and usage. In America, we've designed our entire country around cars to the extent it's almost impossible to imagine any other way of doing things. Societal costs of car supremacy include negative impacts to our local community, and to the global environment.</p>

                    <li>Manhattan, one of the least car-oriented places in the United States, devotes <a href="https://nextcity.org/daily/entry/how-much-public-space-does-a-city-need-UN-Habitat-joan-clos-50-percent">36% of its area</a> to streets, the vast majority of which is dedicated to private cars, <a href="https://www1.nyc.gov/assets/planning/download/pdf/plans/transportation/peripheral_travel_02c.pdf">despite the fact that only 5% of its commutes are by car</a> (and only 7% are by bus).</li>
                    <li>In San Francisco, Golden Gate Park has cars allowed on 92% of its streets, yet advocates <a href="https://www.safeggp.com/">are having to fight to keep the remaining 8% open</a> for people and bikes.</li>
                    <li>Ever wonder why you enjoyed your vacation to Disneyworld, or a dense European city? In part, it's because they were walkable places. In the United States, parking requirements are ubiqitous. Cities like my hometown of Cupertino <a href="https://twitter.com/barakgila/status/1187506814943842305">even require bars to provide parking!</a> Required parking is a self-fulfilling prophecy. When your streets are strip malls littered with parking lagoons, it's miserable to get around any other way than a car.</li>
                </ul>
                <h6>Our car culture is dangerous to to all of us, and particularly harms underrepresented groups and vulnerable demographics.</h6>
                <ul>
                    <li>The <a href="https://www.integrapeople.com/news/2017/05/the-top-10-most-expensive-construction-projects-in-the-world/159#:~:text=The%20Interstate%20Highway%20System%2C%20%24459,almost%2035%20years%20to%20complete.">most expensive public works project in world history</a> was the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interstate_Highway_System">$530 billion</a> (in current dollars) Interstate Highway System. It had some good outcomes, but also facilitated white flight from cities and soul-crushing suburban sprawl. At the time, Black communities had even less political power than they do now, so highways <a href="https://www.vox.com/2015/5/14/8605917/highways-interstate-cities-history">tore through Black communities</a>. Even today, <a href="https://la.streetsblog.org/2020/10/07/city-of-downey-officially-opposes-full-metro-605-5-freeway-widening-impacting-downey-homes/">LA is planning to demolish hundreds of homes</a> for a freeway widening project.</li>
                    <li>There were <a href="https://www.iihs.org/topics/fatality-statistics/detail/yearly-snapshot">36,000 car crash deaths</a> in America in 2019, up from 33,000 a decade ago. The number of injuries is far higher, and even cities with Vision Zero plans aren't making progress (<a href="https://sfgov.org/scorecards/transportation/traffic-fatalities">see SF for example</a>).</li>
                    <li>Americans associate cars with independence, but privileging the convenience of drivers comes at a huge cost to the freedom of everyone else. Kids under the age of 16 and others who cannot drive, like folks who can't afford it, or those with some medical conditions, are treated like second class citizens. Many parents won't let their kids walk half a mile to school, whether in a busy urban area or a sleepy suburb, for fear of traffic violence.</li>
                    <li>Hopefully, you're aware of the environmental costs of carbon emissions from gasoline-powered cars. I'll add that your Tesla is not exempt! Manufacturing a midsize electric vehicle <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/building-electric-cars-how-much-pollution-versus-gas-powered-vehicles-2019-11">produces 15% more emissions</a> than its gasoline-powered equivalent, and that gap grows with battery size. Once that electric car is released to our roads, it produces many of the same particulate emissions (like tire erosion) that are responsible for <a href="https://www.ucsusa.org/resources/vehicles-air-pollution-human-health">30,000 premature American deaths</a> per year.</li>
                    <li>In the past, we put lead in gasoline, which poisoned a generation of Americans (<a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/10845777/#:~:text=The%20CogAT%20norm%20comparisons%20also,at%20lower%20blood%20lead%20levels.&text=The%20findings%20with%20respect%20to,more%20aggressive%20and%20delinquent%20behavior.">lead exposure in children is associated with lower IQ and higher aggression</a>) and arguably contributed to the crime surge in the 1970s and 80s.</li>
                    <li>The more we learn, the worse the health statistics: in 2010, Japanese scientists <a href="https://www.reuters.com/article/us-birth-roads/living-near-a-major-road-tied-to-preterm-birth-study-idUSTRE6B10HA20101202">found</a> that living near a major road was associated with a 50% increase in premature birth. In 2019, Berkeley research <a href="https://are.berkeley.edu/~mlanderson/pdf/air_pollution_highways.pdf">found</a> living downwind of a highway increased mortality by 5% among seniors.</li>

                    <h6>Most of the above problems were governmental and they'll need public solutions.</h6>
                    <p>We'll need public actions more radical than the Green New Deal (which focuses on jobs and public investment) to address them. As a start, I support carbon taxes, bus-only lanes on urban and suburban freeways combined with frequent, convenient service, <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/cities/2015/may/05/amsterdam-bicycle-capital-world-transport-cycling-kindermoord#:~:text=Entire%20Amsterdam%20neighbourhoods%20were%20destroyed,bicycles%20would%20eventually%20disappear%20altogether.&text=All%20that%20growing%20traffic%20took,of%203%2C300%20deaths%20in%201971.">following in Amsterdam's footsteps</a> to transform our cities to prioritize everyone but cars, and then making it more expensive to use cars with congestion pricing and increased registration/per mile fees.</p>
                    <h6>I'll start by changing my own incentives around driving and flying.</h6>
                    <p>Just as plant-focused restaurants might open in a community with many vegans and vegetarians, I hope individual action can encourage a public policy change. I've already made some changes in my behavior since I learned more about urbanism (like getting around the Peninsula by biking and taking Caltrain, rather than always driving), but it's good to align my incentives along these lines.</p>
                    <p>Relatedly, I believe climate change is super important, and among the most important reason to reduce our car usage. So, I decided to start by partially offsetting the carbon emissions of my driving and flying. (I'm excluding non-carbon externalities, costs associated with car/plane manufacturing and disposal, and other indirect costs.)</p>

In theory, I'd divide the resulting 0.3 kg/mile emissions by the total number of people in the vehicle (excluding Uber drivers etc). In practice, this is annoying to do and I'm overestimating all trips as solo instead.</li>
                                <li>I'm using <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1nkGdtmkPmSb4eFxVyarPp7HXFCKR6lTPd-uB0qc5c_w/edit">this calculator from the United Nations'  ICAO</a> for plane emissions.

                             <p>I briefly considered tree-planting organizations, but I'm concerned it's not as scalable or guaranteed. If the forest burns down, the sequestered carbon gets released, whereas the carbon absorbed from olivine eventually becomes limestone, and it's supposed to stay absorbed for millenia.</p>
                            <p><a href="https://climeworks.com/">Climeworks</a> is another organization I considered. Like Project Vesta, it's working on scaling a technology to directly capture carbon from the air. Also like Project Vesta, it's <a href="https://stripe.com/blog/first-negative-emissions-purchases">one of four organizations Stripe donated to</a> in their first phase of climate action (to be honest, I mostly outsourced due diligence to Stripe). However, Project Vesta is a nonprofit, so it's twice as cheap for me to give to them. One downside is that while Climeworks directly attributes some removed carbon to your donation (at a price of $1.10/kg carbon), Project Vesta is a bit more exploratory. At this stage, most of their costs are from measuring their carbon and other ecological impacts of their technology. They quoted Stripe $0.075/kg, and quoted me $0.75/kg.</p>
