                <p>In American cities, it's unfortunately intimidating to get started with bicycle commuting. Traffic safety and theft are the biggest issues. Once you overcome those concerns, it's by far the fastest, funnest, most efficient, and most environmentally-friendly way to get around! I hope this guide helps you get started. By the way, you can avoid theft and up-front costs with bikeshare (not covered in this guide).</p>

                <h4>What you need</h4>
                <p>Don't feel intimidated by spandex-clad cyclists with sleek carbon bikes—you don't need to spend thousands to get started. Here's what I'd recommend you get, in priority order.</p>
                <ol>
                    <li><strong>Bike:</strong> (unless you start with rideshare). Consider buying it used on Craigslist or Facebook Marketplace, or starting with borrowing a friend's bike. If you buy a new bike, consider an e-bike, especially as a commuter. Rad Power Bikes are the market leader, and they cost under $1,500.</li>
                    <li><strong>Lock:</strong> A good U-lock and cable are critical, especially in urban areas. For chill suburban/rural areas, a U-lock alone will probably suffice, but generally <a href="https://thebestbikelock.com/how-to-lock-your-bike/">make sure your U-lock secures the back wheel and frame</a>, and cable secures the front wheel. For high-risk urban areas, I recommend <a href="https://thebestbikelock.com/best-u-lock/">double-locking U-locks</a>, and never leaving a bike unattended with any quick-release elements, like a bike light or seat.</li>
                    <li><strong>Lights:</strong> If you'd ever bike at twilight/night, front and rear lights are a must. Rear lights are under $20, but brighter front lights for $50 are worth it in my opinion (but don't get them stolen, see above.</li>
                    <li><strong>Clippy pedals and bike shoes:</strong> I'd wait until you're several rides in for these. Most road bikers use 3-point clippy pedals; I use 2-point SPD-style ones because I was scared of being stuck clipped in (and these are easier to clip out of). With <a href="https://smile.amazon.com/SHIMANO-PD-EH500-Pedals-Included-Platform/dp/B07FTB9MCW?pldnSite=1">combo pedals</a>, you can use the same pedals for clipped-in road rides and casual commuting.</li>
                    <li><strong>Spandex clothing:</strong> I do wear this for longer rides, but the underwear-less format of the cycling bibs takes a lot of getting used to, and it's expensive.</li>
                </ol>
            </div>

                <h4>Routefinding</h4>
                <p>Finding a good bike route can be the difference between a terrifying trip and a relaxing one. It can be hit and miss, but bike infrastructure in many American cities has gotten better over the last decade and continues to improve.</p>
                <h5><strong>Road hierarchy</strong></h5>
                <p>Here's the types of road surfaces you should prefer, in order starting from the best.</p>
                <div class="row">
                    <div class="three columns">
                        <img style="max-width: 100%; box-sizing: border-box;" src="boulder-creek-path.png" alt="boulder creek path">
                        <p><strong>Paved car-free bike path.</strong> Usually allows pedestrians too, like the Boulder Creek Path to downtown shown above. Boulder has an exceptional network of these multi-use paths.</p>
                    </div>
                    <div class="three columns">
                        <img style="max-width: 100%; box-sizing: border-box;" src="folsom.png" alt="folsom">
                        <p><strong>Protected bike lane</strong>, in which cars are separated from bikes by parking or a buffer. These are less effective when there are many right-turning cars.</p>
                    </div>
                    <div class="three columns">
                        <img style="max-width: 100%; box-sizing: border-box;" src="sunnyvale.png" alt="sunnyvale">
                        <p><strong>Bike lane, no right-hand-side parking.</strong> These can be pretty comfortable, unless they're too narrow, the road surface is bad, or there are many right turns.</p>
                    </div>
                    <div class="three columns">
                        <img style="max-width: 100%; box-sizing: border-box;" src="fulton.png" alt="fulton">
                        <p><strong>Bike lane, with right-hand-side parking.</strong> These can be deceptive, because you're in the door zone, as discussed below. You may need to ignore it and take the car lane.</p>
                    </div>
                </div>
                <p>If none of these options are available, choose between: taking the entire car lane (see below), biking on the road shoulder / right-most part of the lane, or taking the sidewalk (if available) to avoid competing with fast traffic on narrow lanes.</p>
                <h5><strong>Navigation (use Google)</strong></h5>
                <ul>
                    <li>Audio navigation from Google Maps is great. You don't need to pull out your phone (even to start navigation, just ask Google assistant), and it uses road names and is generally easy to follow.</li>
                    <li>Google Maps's bike routefinding is pretty good. It'll minimize elevation gain and prefer roads with bike lanes.</li>
                    <li>Use Street View to scope out potentially sketchy sections of the route in advance.</li>
                    <li>Unfortunately, bike routes tend to end abruptly, funneling you to compete with cars on busy roads. The area around South Wan Ness and Howard St is a good example of this in San Francisco. If you encounter this, or otherwise feel unsafe on your ride, it's fine to head for the sidewalk and either ride on it, or stop and search for an alternate route.</li>
                </ul>
            </div>
