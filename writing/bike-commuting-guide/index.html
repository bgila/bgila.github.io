                <p>In American cities, it's unfortunately intimidating to get started with bicycle commuting. Traffic safety and theft are the biggest issues. Once you overcome those concerns, it's by far the fastest, funnest, most efficient, and most environmentally-friendly way to get around! I hope this guide helps you get started. By the way, you can avoid theft and up-front costs with bikeshare (not covered in this guide).</p>

                <h5><strong>What you need</strong></h5>
                <p>Don't feel intimidated by spandex-clad cyclists with sleek carbon bikes—you don't need to spend thousands to get started. Here's what I'd recommend you get, in priority order.</p>
                <ol>
                    <li><strong>Bike:</strong> (unless you start with rideshare). Consider buying it used on Craigslist or Facebook Marketplace, or starting with borrowing a friend's bike. If you buy a new bike, consider an e-bike, especially as a commuter. Rad Power Bikes are the market leader, and they cost under $1,500.</li>
                    <li><strong>Lock:</strong> A good U-lock and cable are critical, especially in urban areas. For chill suburban/rural areas, a U-lock alone will probably suffice, but generally <a href="https://thebestbikelock.com/how-to-lock-your-bike/">make sure your U-lock secures the back wheel and frame</a>, and cable secures the front wheel. For high-risk urban areas, I recommend <a href="https://thebestbikelock.com/best-u-lock/">double-locking U-locks</a>, and never leaving a bike unattended with any quick-release elements, like a bike light or seat.</li>
                    <li><strong>Lights:</strong> If you'd ever bike at twilight/night, front and rear lights are a must. Rear lights are under $20, but brighter front lights for $50 are worth it in my opinion (but don't get them stolen, see above.</li>
                    <li><strong>Clippy pedals and bike shoes:</strong> I'd wait until you're several rides in for these. Most road bikers use 3-point clippy pedals; I use 2-point SPD style ones because I was scared of being stuck clipped in (and these are easier to clip out of). With <a href="https://smile.amazon.com/SHIMANO-PD-EH500-Pedals-Included-Platform/dp/B07FTB9MCW?pldnSite=1">combo pedals</a>, you can use the same pedals for clipped-in road rides and casual commuting.</li>
                    <li><strong>Spandex clothing:</strong> I do wear this for longer rides, but the underwear-less format of the cycling bibs takes a lot of getting used to, and it's expensive.</li>
