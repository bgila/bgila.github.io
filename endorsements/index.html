            <h5><strong>There's an election?</strong></h5>
            <p>There's an election going on now through March 3, where you can vote not just for President but also DCCC members (Democratic endorsers), judges, and local propositions.</p>
        </div>
        <div>
            <h5><strong>How do I participate?</strong></h5>
            <p>It's ✨easy and free ✨ for U.S. citizens to register at <a href="https://registertovote.ca.gov/">https://registertovote.ca.gov/</a>. It only takes 5 minutes, so do it right now.</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Register as a <strong>Democrat</strong> (regardless of your political beliefs), because then you can vote in the Democratic presidential primary, and for the DCCC (see below for an explainer)</li>
                <li> Check the box to <strong>receive a ballot by mail</strong> so you can vote from the comfort of your own home, using a postage-paid envelope!
                </li>
                <li>Register, or re-register as a Democrat, by <strong>Feb 18</strong>, the deadline (if you miss it, you can still go vote in person).</li>
            </ul>
        </div>
        <div>
            <h5><strong>Why should I vote?</strong></h5>
            <p>At the state and local level, your vote isn't wasted!</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Do you live or work in San Francisco?</strong> There's a ballot prop that would shrink San Francisco's GDP and population by more than 5% if it passes.</li>
                <li><strong>Is your rent too high?</strong> Housing is almost exclusively a local and state, not federal, issue. Vote for policies that will build more homes and lower your rent.</li>
                <li><strong>Sick of gerrymandering and the electoral college?</strong> Local and state ballot props are by popular vote and are less partisan: your vote counts!</li>
                <li>Finally, young people and renters vote at a fraction of the rate older people and homeowners do, so by voting you'll be helping to correct that imbalance and ensure your interests are heard. </li>
            </ul>

        <h3>The details</h3>
    </div>
    <div class="container" id="dccc">
        <section class="header">
            <h5><strong>The Democratic County Central Committee (DCCC)</strong></h5>
            <h5>What is it?</h5>
            <p>The DCCC is the group that determines who the "San Francisco Democratic Party" endorses. As you can imagine, the Democratic Party has a fair bit of clout in SF, so having their official endorsement makes a substantial difference in how people vote.</p>
            <p>By registering Democratic and voting for DCCC candidates that share your pro-housing, progressive values, you are influencing politics in SF positively.</p>
            <h5>How'd you decide who to endorse?</h5>
            <p>I outsourced my endorsements here to <a href="https://yimbyaction.org/join/">YIMBY Action</a> (Yes in my backyard), San Francisco's main pro-housing group. <a href="https://medium.com/@sfyimby/sf-yimby-endorsements-for-march-2020-a3c188527940">Here are</a> their full endorsements.</p>
            <h5 id="badleague">Aside: the SF League of Pissed Off Voters is bad</h5>
            <p>Another helpful resource (for who not to vote for) was the SF League of Pissed Off Voters. They sent candidates a <a href="http://www.theleaguesf.org/march_2020_candidate_questionnaires">questionnaire</a> full of litmus tests for their preferred policies, which are bad, at least on housing.
                The League wants candidates to oppose SB 50, our state’s best hope for building more homes quickly. They also wanted candidates to oppose any market-rate housing on public land, even if that land could subsidize additional affordable units to be built too. I <a href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1AqF9ebsOrxkjk9Khhc3ND1cci3-Fu4PNSXTb9-GQlzI/edit#gid=0">tabulated</a> everyone’s responses to these questions, and most of the non-YIMBY-endorsed candidates agree to positions which would result in fewer homes to be built.</p>
            <p>(Curiously for a group that purports to be pissed off, their questionnaire also asks prospective DCCC members to promise to endorse the incumbents in 4 of the 6 upcoming supervisor races. A DCCC member should endorse whomever they feel is the best candidate depending on their values, issue positions, and political considerations; binding them to endorsing incumbents greatly reduces the power of the DCCC.)
            </p>
            <h5><strong>U.S. Representative, District 12</strong></h5>
            <p>I support <strong>Nancy Pelosi</strong> for reelection. She is the current Speaker of the House of Representatives. Though I do wish we had a younger generation of leadership in Congress, she’s been effective in running the House, getting bills passed, and managing impeachment in a popular way.</p>
            <p>Her most prominent opponent, <strong>Shahid Buttar</strong>, is a democratic socialist in the Bernie vein. An interesting endorsement for him is by Cory Doctorow. As you can imagine, almost everyone has endorsed Pelosi.</p>
            <h5><strong>State Senator, District 11</strong></h5>
            <div class="row">
                <div class="five columns">
                    <p><strong>Scott Wiener</strong> is the best legislator I’ve ever known. He’s been tireless in advocating for more housing, our state’s biggest issue. Though SB 50 has recently failed in the State Senate, he’ll be back with other housing bills in the coming months, and SB 50 (and its predecessor SB 827) have already changed the housing conversation. Wiener did pass SB 35, which has led to <a href="https://medium.com/yimby/the-latest-on-vallco-explained-9d379c9a2773">the under-construction 2000-home project in Cupertino at the site of Vallco.</a></p>
                    <p>Among many other bills, Wiener wrote California’s bill protecting net neutrality, and has been working to extend nightlife hours so that bars can be open until 4am.</p>
                </div>
                <div class="seven columns">
                    <a href="https://twitter.com/scott_wiener/status/968938785978241024">
                        <img style="max-width: 100%; box-sizing: border-box;" src="/wiener village.jpeg" alt="wiener village"></a>
                </div>
            </div>
            <p>By contrast, his most prominent opponent, Jackie Fielder, has a housing plan to spend $100B over 10 years to build 100,000 more homes. Unfortunately, we have a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/California_housing_shortage">shortage of more than 3 million homes</a> (we are 49th in housing units per resident), so this would barely make a dent in the crisis.</p>
            <h5><strong>State Assembly, District 17</strong></h5>
            <p><strong>David Chiu</strong> is running unopposed. Conveniently, he’s endorsed Wiener’s SB 50, and has <a href="https://www.sfchronicle.com/politics/article/Californians-home-mortgage-deduction-would-be-14960585.php">introduced AB 1905</a> to limit the CA mortgage interest deduction. (Did you know you can’t deduct your rent from your state taxes, but you can deduct interest from your mortgage on even your second house in Tahoe?)</p>
            <h5><strong>State Assembly, District 19</strong></h5>
            <p><strong>Phil Ting</strong> is also the most pro-housing candidate, having endorsed SB 50.</p>
            <h5><strong>Judges</strong></h5>
            <p>I outsourced these endorsements to the <a href="https://projects.sfchronicle.com/2020/voter-guide/endorsements/">SF Chronicle.</a> In each case, they selected the more mainstream candidate with more endorsements from other judges and elected officials.</p>
            <p>Note that in each case, the SF League of Pissed Off Voters <a href="#badleague">(which is bad)</a> endorsed the opposite candidate.</p>
            <br>
            <h4>The propositions</h4>
